# Debt-Tracker
Personal Project to implement HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL

NOTE: This is Version 1.0 while the logic is implemented some updates need to be made:
  -Some stying corrections
  -Bug that makes you double-click on the "create tracker" button before moving on

General Outline of Project:
  -Debt-Tracker is a full-stacked project that implements self-learned languages.
  -Debt-Tracker is an application that allows users to sign up to create trackers for multiple debts. The user will also give each tracker a date "deadline" for when they want to pay off their debt.
   The application will also allow them to update how much they have paid toward the debt. This will prompt the application to give them a timeline of how much they must pay daily to reach their goal.

How To Run Application (All Done On Local Host & used SQLite to open with live server):

Step 1: In the terminal cd to "start" and then type " node create_db.mjs"
Step 2: In the same terminal type " node tracker_create_db.mjs"
Step 3: Open 3 new terminals:
        -In each new terminal cd to "start" file
        -In the first new terminal type "node server.mjs"
        -In the second new terminal type "node login_server.mjs"
        -In the last new terminal type "node tracker_server.mjs"
Step 4: Run "index.html" in the "first_page" folder
